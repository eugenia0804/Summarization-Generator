So during collaborator activity, you want to see the work. They've done the Progressive Party walk. How does the work integrate in contribute to the final results of collaboration and recovery disk activity, you know?",,,,15,0,2,9,14,-1,64

I feel like that does have to be set by the group beforehand, right? But I guess the way for the platform to do that, I mean, like you said, we won't think about implementation, but I feel like, yeah.

140,Danny Pineda,0:12:15,"So this we'll just agree with that. So I think we should also try to.

Yeah I think quality for party but I feel like what's harder is coming up with the criteria for like what does good quality mean or what does high quality mean?,,,,17,9,9,4,17,-1,53
141,John Sanchez,0:09:37,"I feel like that does have to be set by the group beforehand, right? But I guess the way for the platform to do that, I mean, like you said, we won't think about implementation, but I feel like, yeah. The only challenges like how, how can the platform like assess quality and like a consistent way. But yeah, but I think quality over quantity for sure.",,,,21,7,4,10,15,-1,67

141,John Sanchez,0:11:58," I think when it comes individually, we should take quantity, an account, because when there's like, more people in a group, there's some individuals that feel blessed and like, like, they don't feel like they want to share their ideas out, or they don't feel like, oh, like this is a good enough. Like I've already said this, I like, we'll just agree with that. So I think we should also try to. I don't like, I think quantity is also important in terms of",,,,22,7,3,9,14,-1,85
141,John Sanchez,0:12:23,Bring the quality of the discussion because not every individual is going to feel comfortable enough to share out their ideas.,,,,29,0,5,5,14,-1,21
141,John Sanchez,0:12:34, You were saying Audrey. You're saying quantity for the individual but not necessarily put the group like quantity in a group. It's all right. How many are in the group and then like measure the quality of each individual like already contributed,,,,14,0,5,9,14,-1,42
141,John Sanchez,0:12:52," Well, thank you for group discussions to measure. Like, if it was a good discussion before the meeting have objectives and see if you reach so different levels of objectives, how far did you get with in the in the discussion? So you hit the first reject, the second objective, it was a pretty good meeting what we could have done more and then you can look more into that. Like why didn't we reach? Even if we had our meeting with",,,,18,0,6,11,12,-1,82
141,John Sanchez,0:13:19,Reach all four of her things that we want to talk about. We didn't get there and maybe near the end to somehow be able to sort of measure the tone of me discussion before being - you were being positive. I think that could be another aspect of quality for the discussion.,,,,19,4,4,2,6,-1,53
141,John Sanchez,0:13:38," I think also the objectives and stuff. I feel like it might be useful for the group to input their objectives and like their goals for the meeting, or the work session or whatever like before head. And then I don't know what people's thoughts on this are but like what's it called? I was thinking of, at the end of it, like at the end of the group session or whatever you rank, how far he's everyone drinks like, just like quickly skills and find out how much progress you think we made on this? Maybe, I don't know. I mean to me.",,,,21,6,2,11,11,-1,104

141,John Sanchez,0:15:18," then you don't have anything to measure for Quality. So lonely without quality on the information on the Olympus you have. So it's already uses County includes and I'm just watching. So I think all of you made good sense of quality is important. And point is also very, very important but it's a little more subjective versus the last project that I worked on is getting bunch of different experience levels. So pH units and the first year I brought some stuff.",,,,17,5,7,11,10,-1,83

143,Tochukwu,0:13:22, Maybe in Union to somehow be able to sort of measure the tone of a discussion before being negative will be positive. I think another aspect of quality for discussion. I think also with the objectives and stuff. I feel like it,,,,19,7,2,5,10,-1,42

How, how much progress do you think we made on this? Maybe, I don't know. I mean to me that I feel like that sounds kind of cumbersome like, like you don't really want to do that after every meeting. But, but up until this point,",,,,21,5,5,9,13,-1,78

143,Tochukwu,0:14:35,"And even if we spending a lot of time, you know, doing one little thin based on the difficulty of that activity. Even if we don't do as much, we can also say yes good quality because whatever we to achieve our opponent and can constitute quality work done. That makes sense and also agree with you, which quantity because you can't measure quality with that. Keep, there's a little bit",,,,26,0,7,14,12,-1,71
143,Tochukwu,0:15:05," Pressure of quantity. If you can, you should expect before you can begin to talk about quality, right? Because if we don't even imagine what individually each person is contributing, then we're gonna have anything to measure for Quality. So you want a bit of quality on the information on the on the inputs you have so if I were to give his County includes if I'm just going to be. So I think all of you made a good sense of quality is important.",,,,19,3,6,10,13,-1,85

So that way, when we are logged in, you know, very set up the system and that was kinda makes sense. That's good. Yeah, thanks for the contribution. That beautiful was now, our question is,",,,,17,4,4,8,8,-1,76

143,Tochukwu,0:17:29,Yeah I want to say that like if you measure someone there the quantity and quality of someone's work ethic that will tell you a good job or a bad job was done. Yeah. Yeah.,,,,11,3,6,8,8,-1,35
143,Tochukwu,0:17:52, So the mission is to be fast and everything before you guys say goodbye. So I think,,,,12,6,6,18,6,-1,17

143,Tochukwu,0:19:12,acting is present in such a way that,,,,0,0,0,0,0,-1,8
143,Tochukwu,0:19:15," because we are trying to give feedback to the to the participants at the end of the day, right? And I want to be as objective as possible. We don't want to buy us, we don't be subjective. Wanted to be wanted to be to be like it. Yeah. What did you measure them? And let's do. The question is, how can the results will be presented?",,,,16,1,4,9,7,-1,67
143,Tochukwu,0:19:36," So, you're not just looking at the results, you could, you know, I do to do this an objective measurement of what went to science. You don't feel like, oh, I could do so much more, but the system is not. Give me. So, what are the things that we need to put into conceptual system? To guarantee objective feedback out - that's presentation?",,,,18,5,2,6,11,-1,64

So like multi, we are like to ba progress bars showing the different stages of the work done by each participant's and then the group as a whole, but not not of the participant that could change personal just of suppose, somebody's believe in you are, okay, that's obvious. If they could be one part of the UI, okay?",,,,21,0,1,10,6,-1,65
