Let's sort of three takeaways one is that multiple interfaces can be away for trying to promote accessibility one of the Technologies and the tools that we've been working on Multi, craft.
Universe has got some medicine and then Aziza is a master student, all the others are current PT students, either in computer science or earning Sciences computer science plus learning Sciences or technology and social behavior really want to acknowledge all these people because they're the ones that really allow the lab Community to grow and to do the kind of work that I'm going to be sharing with you all today.
And to you know temp the the the demo Gods we're going to try to have a quick little interactive interactive thing where you guys and it's also connected to one of the platforms that my life isn't working on called blink which is a platform it's called building literacy and in-person collaboration and it's a tool that I really like audio information about small group discussions and then provides I mean providing some ethylene the processing on that information and start to tell people think about how their collaborations went.
One of the things that we change in the newer version is that people can actually see their own data and I won't bore you guys with all the backstory behind that now you come asking about it later on if you want.

One of the things you can change in the newer version is that people can actually see their own data and I won't bore you guys with own backstory behind that.
And I want you guys to think about this question, what does it mean to design an inclusive learning environment, particularly in the context of computer science?
Just take like two minutes and and discuss  But Lee, I want you guys to take, like, 2 minutes or so, and I want you guys to think about this question, what does it mean to design an inclusive learning environment, particularly in the context of computer and it takes like two minutes  But the, I want you guys to turn to someone next to you take like, 2 minutes or so.
Good burn design next, you take like two minutes ago and I want you guys to think about this question.
What does it mean to design inclusive learning environment, particularly in the context of computer science take like two minutes and discuss and then we will will come together.
My next to you take like, 2 minutes or so and I want you guys to think about this question, what does it mean to design inclusive?
Take like 2 minutes or so and I want you guys to think about this question, what does it mean to design an inclusive learning environment, particularly in content?
Students, if I'm not also the educator with the Educators goal for happening in this space, I feel like all of those are very influenced by like the people who are, I think part of Designing, a learning environment.
See Sign space, necessitates the ability to adapt things that you didn't think because anyone can walk into this classroom and my goal is that they are able to learn here that might require me to change how this, how I'm making the approach versus expecting the student to try and change the space.
Yes. Inclusive design space, necessitates the ability to adapt to things that you didn't think because anyone can walk into this classroom, and if my goal is that they are able to learn here that might require me to change him that, how amazing that approach versus expecting the student to try and change in space.
Part of what I'm going to sort of ground today, is some of the ways that I'm thinking about, really tilted whole things about includes, and how to design for sort of inclusive, learning experiences, computer is inclusive, learning computer science, and broadly speaking.
Peter and broadly speaking, I think about that, as integrating multiple learning, multiple interfaces and multiple analytics and to give you some more details around that, what are they going?
An exercise that what I'm talking about people interfaces think about what are the tools that are available to support that learning.
One of the things that make it easier for students to be able to Grapple with and learn more about different ideas and then how do those tools again, align with the Learners needs and goals and then in turn the multiple and our analytics is how much we measure learning, what are the sort of  And to give you some more details around that, whatever you are multiple learning.
And you know, one of the tools that are available to support that money, what are the things that make it easier for students to be able to Grapple with and learn about different views?
So this is a work is funded by NSF cyber learning or that we just, we just rolled off and really a lot of motivation for this was because we wanted to, we really had started to explore ways to make morning and Minecraft more accessible by allowing people with disabilities, someone who may have a fine  People buy a lot of people disabilities, so someone who may have a fine motor impairment, someone who may be blind and visually impaired to be able to equitably participate within a game.
When you think about it, it's sort of like this virtual Lego game, where players can put down in different blocks and we can come structures and actually make like fully functioning kinds of schemes, but you can make it, you can verbalize really using natural language instructions and build a 5 by 8 by 7 gold structure and it'll build that structure for you.
So being able to study someone's brain waves as a way to sort of regulate the type of movement that's taking place within within the game using things like gestures also.
So being able to study someone's brain waves as a way to sort of regulate the type of movement that's taking place within within the game using things like gestures also.","Overall Summary: The conversation discussed the importance of designing for inclusivity in computer science, specifically looking at multiple interfaces, multiple analytics, and multiple technologies. 
Details and Decisions: 
• Multiple interfaces can be used to promote accessibility 
• Technologies such as MultiCraft and Aziza are being used to help with this 
• An interactive tool called Blink is being used to provide audio information about small group discussions 
• People can now see their own data in the newer version 
• Designing an inclusive learning environment requires the ability to adapt to different students 
• Multiple learning, multiple interfaces, and multiple analytics are being used to study brain waves and regulate movement in the game.",48872,6460,765
2023-05-17 00:27:30,"We also want to be clever things, things start to work differently when you have wooden blocks that multiple people can come around together and build with.
That's provide a picture on but actually in the game environment and study, what are the visual cues that they're paying attention to partially with the hypothesis that some of the spatial reasoning practices that students might use on a traditional multi mental rotation test.
So in this sort of specific kind of tasks we have to do is recreate this structure that's provided in this picture but actually the game environment and study, what are the visual cues that they're paying attention to partially with the hypothesis that some I think we can also use that same idea of data to study how they are looking at different visual relationships with different spatial components that they're interacting with within the game.
So in this sort of specific kind of task would have students, do is recreate this structure that's provided his picture on but actually in the game environment and study, what are the visual cues that they're paying attention to partially with the hypothesis that some of the spatial reasoning practices that students might use on a traditional Looking at different visual relationships, different spatial components that they're interacting with within the game.
So just an example though, of thinking about what you can do with multi mode input and the thoughts of multiple input, as a way to promote accessibility, but also within this project, Of the spatial reasoning practices that students might use on a traditional multiple mental rotation test.
So, just an example though, thinking about what you can do with multi mode input and the importance of multiple inputs as a way to promote accessibility, but also,  one is that you've been doing Innovative and novel things, you're his kind of game environment that they don't even do on so that there's new affordances that I can come back.
National learning also, facilitating practices come with skills and then multiple data can also be way to go about setting on and that's really one of the big things that the blink project is trying to do.
So part of the bling project is really around this question of what to do collaboration look like, now researchers have come up with all sorts The prolific multiple input, opens up new opportunities, and possibilities for inclusive neck.
I won't go go through through all these, but we're really trying to ground the ideas of the information that we provide to students through blank and, you know, ideally this is the platform that we would use in a sort of college level class where students are engaging with discussions with one another and make sure that information aligns with the sort of the questions that they have for the way that they want to think of clever Asian.
But we're really trying to ground the ideas of the information that we provide to students through blank and, you know, ideally this is a platform that you can use in a sort of college level class where students are engaging with discussions with one another to make sure that information.The more reason, then this work, we've done to identify different constructs and surveys.
I won't go through all of these, but we're really trying to round the ideas of the information that we provide to students through blank and ideally this is a platform that you use in a sort of college level class for students are engaging in discussions with one another and make sure that information aligned with sort of questions that they have for the way that they want to think about coverages and now  it is actually in some of This Blink data and again I apologize that this is the older version.
So the conversation that you guys have started to have and part of what blink wants his trying to support is ways for students to be able to go back and sort of the first winter instructor field.
We start to see the rest of the conversation, doesn't conversation that you guys have started to have and part of what blink wants his trying to support is ways for students to be able to go back and sort of first way for instructors, go to the back and look at what conversation, what are the conversations are happening about being able to identify things like questions that might come up.
So I think I had one right here, so being able to collect  Conversations are happening across the different groups, being able to identify things like questions that might come up.
and part of what blink wants his trying to support is ways for students to be able to go back and sort of first, wait for stuff to go back and look at once the conversation, one of the conversations are happening across the different routes, being able to identify things like questions that might come up.
Broadly speaking, the idea here is there's neat ways that we can think about using analytics to both studies student learning but also be able to support  For actually launching a discussion, they can provide a set of materials and use that to build topic models.
The idea here is there's many ways that we can think about using analytics to Improvise a set of materials and use that to build topic models so that you can actually start to see how students are sampling across two different topics within within the course materials.
Soon, a plates about their perceptions of computer science, and we're currently working on developing and testing some ways for Youth and student athletes to be able to collect data about their Sports activity, and then subsequent to be able to use that data to train models, to be able to come up with different sort of predictions, around their own behavior.
Two of this of this award is to give you an idea of the sort of the timeline things, we're doing really spent last year and was introduced with student athletes about their perceptions of computer science and currently working on developing and testing some ways.
And we're currently working on developing and testing some ways for Youth and student athletes, to be able to collect data about their Sports activity and then subsequently be able to use that data, to train models, to be able to prove, More things coming down the line sort of increasing, increasingly adding complexity.","Overall Summary: The conversation discussed ways to use analytics to study student learning, support instructors, and collect data from student athletes to train models and make predictions.

2023-05-17 00:44:00,"I sort of put together, this set of six, different ways of thinking of inclusion that we really try to exemplify within the sport since project.
This set of six different ways of thinking about inclusion, that we really try to exemplify within the sports and project.
This set of six different ways of thinking about inclusion, that we really try to exemplify within the sports and project.
This set of six different ways of thinking about inclusion, that we really try to exemplify within the sports and project.
We also have ways that we actually connect with course,  He's so in terms of content, you know, one of the things that we've that we've done is started to, you know, really focused on Sports a number of the things that you're seeing here are technologies that think that we  Of the starting points for our, curriculum is Spider-Man into the fibers to have students.
I think about what are the ways that shifting the content itself, in this case, making the content delivery tied around Sports, can start to draw people in and start to really promote inclusion.
That's fact that you're like you and something countercultural that they're doing things, something to disrupt what was intended or when they are uncovering some sort of Is apartment and start to see the inner workings of those Technologies or find ways to trick those Technologies.
And then the other big part of it is, you know, students are ultimately trying to design new sports Technologies and so here you're seeing this drawing.
And so one of the other component that we do within this we will actually like having to take one of these new technologies and start to see the inner workings of the Technologies or find ways to trick the and the process is going to take those Technologies and then the other part of it is you know students are  Secret.
And so one of the other components that we do within this curriculum is we will actually like have students take one of these these Technologies apart and start to see the inner workings of those Technologies or find ways to trick those Technologies.
We're also partnering with actual like youth sports teams and if the content as a way to promote inclusion,  We can also do shift the context and so here I'm showing sort of representation of the thing about the in school versus out of school, right?
And so, the ways that shifting, the context can also be a way for inviting people in and it has another side, even, you know, for the class I teach here at Northwestern sports, technology, learning, we sometimes do those class sessions at the gym.
So, similarly, you know, some other pictures, this is work that we did a couple summers ago and she probably Parks District again, just getting students together in a gym and conversation around designing these different sorts of wearables both different year than when you're in a traditional classroom space.
So be away for inviting people in and it says other side, even, you know, for the classic teach here in Northwestern sports technology morning, sometimes, see those class sessions at the gym and it's different when you have students programming, these microcontrollers sitting at the gym versus sitting in a more traditional classic, it opens us different types of interactive different types of conversations.
It's okay to you're not gonna get shocked but this way is that the selection of the tools themselves start to impact how people want to go about approaching engaging with those different Technologies, LM relieved.
Not just from the perspective of is someone's going to be  This to say it's okay to throw this up in the air, it's okay to like cause it to your friends, it's okay to you're not going to be shocked but just ways that the selection of the tools themselves, start to impact how people want to go about approaching and engaging with the different Technologies.
Runs the scratches are sort of locked based use trig of environments, and one of the challenges know that we came across is that scratch only allows you to connect a single microbe it to the program to the program at the top.And within scratch program hook, the part of we're trying to do is develop these tools sets that more closely aligned with the ways that you could want to use these Technologies and context of sports.
We're trying to do is develop these tool sets that more closely aligned with the ways that you can want to use these Technologies Sports.
And I put  And 2:00 that simple shift meant from meant that the number of student athletes that I had with in my sport technology and learning class like quadrupled.
And you know, we see a little bit of a shift to your in students more through this thing disagree with with eight people and didn't go try to do it.
And even these sort of broad perceptions of computer science, something, as important that or that is fun, / says, going to close off with the about 45 quotation, students to talk sports are now joining us is one of the earlier I used to think that computer science is only about programming and so did nothing else at all.
So students started to see a grounding a space for all the course, we'll get that done and in the area like sports, really cool to see how our classic cell phone during skills can be preferable to the field trip in sports the class, but A New Perspective and how I can still combine with technical skills, with my personal interests were going through  I never thought I had much interest in this but I see it differently now and it's something that is worth taking a look at for possible future, right?","Overall Summary: The conversation discussed six different ways of thinking about inclusion in sports and how to promote it through content, context, and tools.
Details and Decisions: 
-Content delivery is focused on sports to draw people in and promote inclusion.
-Shifting the context can also be a way to invite people in, such as having class sessions at the gym.
-Tools are selected to impact how people engage with different technologies.
-Students are encouraged to combine their technical skills with their personal interests.",49569,5583,533
2023-05-17 01:17:30,"And another big thing that we really going to do is look at student student generated artifacts here to seeing a picture of volleyball sleeve like them student made within within the class for trying to help people do a better Bond job, when the trying to bump the ball in volleyball, being with the tech for those purposes are and that's definitely One Direction trying to go.
The other thing really can think about is developing new Youth Sports Technologies, part of being in many of these faces and seeing both how students use the existing professional Technologies as well as being in conversation with coaches and parents is starting to highlight some of the opportunities for creating new types of sports wearables.
So, how much time are they spending with the head looking down versus actually looking around the basketball court, which is, you know, Common challenge across different view Sports seeing similar examples of people trying to  Part of being in many of these faces and seeing both how students use existing professional Technologies as well as being a conversation with coaches and parents is starting to highlight some of the opportunities for creating new types of sports wearables.
So, how much time are they spending with their head looking down versus actually looking around the basketball court, which is, you know, Common challenge across different, she supports these similar examples of people trying to practice starting in sports, like, track and field.
Think about what it means to design these different types of computer science book, learning experiences, that try to promote inclusion and tried to sort of talk through some of these three different, these three different angles.
I think part of what we are really trying to do is push connection, books connection to local people who you can actually engage and interact with and that that seem accessible that seem like, you know, it's one thing to, you know, to see someone end of that showing them a picture of someone who maybe they look up to, or sort of like a role model kind of thing, but without the personal connection, Famous doing something but it's different when it's someone within your own local space.
A picture here shows somebody something is different than when they interact with in and actually start to experience some level of Joy, some level of satisfaction That I think it's one thing, right?
I'm hoping to do in the near future is is also sort of a media campaign around people will kind of beenCanvas support technology space so that that becomes one piece of it because I think those types of images and those have experienced have a different reach like it's much easier to be able to pull it out and image, put up the video then to set up a number of different local experiences for you.
What's kind of thing more people get different if and so you can't do one or the other, but it's often every time you add something, it almost like, yeah, I know.
If you want to be able to type it in and we actually found a lot of people still really like to just go text-based but yeah, I think I think part of it.
Someone who is fully sighted, that kind of thing.You've got speed phase, input tangibles, the Tigers, you got still text-based, if you want to be able to type it in and we actually found a lot of people still really like to just go text-based but yeah I think I think part of it is this something I talk about in some of the makings of building stuff is we also want to start to be clear about our assumptions?","Overall Summary: The conversation discussed the use of student-generated artifacts to help people do a better job in volleyball, the development of new youth sports technologies, designing computer science books to promote inclusion, and the use of media campaigns to reach more people.
