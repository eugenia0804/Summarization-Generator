So some of the things they raised, that's the only information about to help them know in the collaboration, has good quality, or look what you done with the can review that postdoc or real-time and see how they can adjust.
A people speak of any person who is seeking more than the other unintelligible patient of time to speak to some of the things they respect the ocean commission about to let them know compromise on quality review that useful for real-time actually command.
So the question we are going to ask, do you think quality quantity and quality of work done during the Collaborative Learning need to be evaluated?Results of the economy.
So the question I'm going to ask you think quality quantity and quality of work done during a Collaborative Learning need to be evaluated.
You think the quantity and the quality of work done during the Collaborative Learning Miss Yvonne?
because a lot of people to hijack discussion,  I think quality more than quantity because a lot of people can hijack a group discussion and say a lot of things, but then it doesn't give the space for everybody to talk.
So if you like the content that's coming out, should be given more of a priority, maybe quality a little bit just to make sure that people actually do contribute.
I think a lot of people to hijack, the content, maybe quality a little bit, just to make sure that actually contribute  I think quality more than quantity because a lot of people can hijack a group discussion and say a lot of things but then it doesn't give the it doesn't get to space.
I was going to say like I would want to say that quality is more important than quantity is my answer.
Yeah I was gonna say like I would want to say that quality is more important than quantity is my answer.
Yeah I was going to say like I would want to say that quality is more important than quantity of my answer?
Yeah I was going to say like I would want to say that quality is more important than quantity of my answer?
Yeah I think quality for party but I feel like what's harder is coming up with the criteria for like what does good quality mean or what does high quality mean?
Yeah, I think quality required but I feel like what's harder is coming up with the criteria.
Yeah, I think all but I feel like what's harder is coming up with the criteria for like what does good quality?
Yeah, I think quality was quiet but I feel like what's harder is coming up with a criteria for like, what this good quality, or what?
He said that he won't think about implementation but I feel like yeah, the only challenges like how, how can a platform like assess quality of a consistent way.
But yeah, the thing quality over quantity for sure.I feel like that does have to be set by the group beforehand, right?
For, I think when it comes individually we should take quantity in account because when there is like, more people in a group, there's some individuals that feel less 10 like, like, they don't mushroom, the quality of To be for each individual in the group.
Look at these books, individual, another group quantity and account, because there's like, more people in that group, there's some individuals that feel blessed act, like they don't really want to share their ideas out or they don't feel like this is a good agree with that.
I don't like, I think quantity is also important in terms ofThey don't want to share their ideas out or do you feel like, oh, this is a good enough.
So I think we should also try to like I think quantity is also important in terms of measuring the quality of the discussion because not every individual is that I feel  There's some individuals that feel less than like, like they don't really want to share their ideas out or they don't feel like, oh, like this is a good enough like ever.
Like I think quantity is also important in terms of measuring the quality of the discussion because not every individual is going to feel confident enough to share out their ideas.
I don't like I think quantity is also important in terms of measuring the quality looks you're saying Audrey, you're saying quantity for the individual but not necessarily for the group.
So I think we should also try to like, I think, what is also important in terms of measuring the quality is not, every individual is going to feel comfortable to share out their ideas.
So it sort of uses County in fields like because which I think all of you made good sense of quality.
Based on what we did we can do and if we achieve those that seen as a quantitatively good amount of work,  So with setting goals, I feel like you need to divide  And everybody knows different things.
Yeah I want to say that like if you measure someone there the quantity and quality of someone's record like that will tell you if a good job or a bad job was done.
Yeah, I want to say that like if you measure someone or the quantity and quality of someone's working like that will tell you if a good job or a bad job was that.
Yeah I want to say that like if you measure someone there the quantity and quality of someone's work ethic that will tell you a good job or a bad job was done.
Yeah, I want to say that like if you measure some one third of the quantity and quality of someone's very carefully that will tell you the job for ya.","Overall Summary: The conversation discussed the need to evaluate the quality and quantity of work done during collaborative learning, as well as the criteria for assessing quality.
Details and Decisions:
- The importance of quality over quantity was discussed, as well as the difficulty of setting criteria for what constitutes good quality.
- It was suggested that measuring the quantity and quality of someone's work can tell if a good job or a bad job was done.
- It was also suggested that goals should be divided among the group to ensure everyone is contributing.",49741,5411,569
2023-05-17 00:36:00,"It could really actually to reduce objective measurements but you don't feel like, oh, I could do so much more but he said he's going to do.
And we also know, if you see a bunch of tasks and how much their community and everybody knows what the time to do, so, I think like when you assign tasks as the goals, so you know, how much of that task is finished?
So instead of  I think like when you assign tasks of the goals, so, you know, how much of that task is finished?
Okay, so my multi-view are making progress bars showing the different stages of the work done by each response, and then the group  Saying that somebody finish something you can say that this task is completed so much.
So like multi, we are like to ba progress bars showing the different stages of the work done by each participant's and then the group as a whole, but not not of the participant that could change personal just of suppose, somebody's believe in you are, okay, that's obvious.
To what you were supposed to be working on or what like you contribute it to, I think that seems Seems good to me.
Do I say, okay, I think I have a way of bypassing like story after the  Because this is not going to using.
So we're doing something we're differently when they go to such extreme but some days you're going to talk more than likely  Okay.
But the some days you are going to talk more than like other other meetings believe you're doing something super crazy, because you think that's enough.
Because you think that's gonna, I don't know up, you up, maybe like to prevent that.You up.
But I think you can just take the mice too emotional opportunity, like key in the progress of the work that is system automatically determine dots from the bank so that you have people bringing in their own point of view or what if you did.
Hopefully, not most of these look like they want to see why I don't see how much time do you spend activity?
Sounds like you want to see quite a tour to see how much time he spends you know, my time is spent discussing about that.
Had a little stressful  For the Love of most of the world, like, the world, see boys, that want to see how much time it spends activity, you know, more than we spent discussing how much time you spend What about you think that people to know your Mo?
And then like you just measure from when it started to like when it was like significantly talked about and then what it's like the last time that keyword showed up  Use as much as you want to start it tonight.
I think you would plot how often it was like use during a certain time period.
So I think you know, it's important to look at like the frequency of the keyword and like record what the moments that it was like really frequent.
So I think, you know, it's important to look at like the frequency of the keyword and like, record with the moment that it was a really frequent.
Isn't that, like strictly deciding what's considered used for than what's not in terms of conversation and collaboration thinking work?
I spy my speech a tells me how much time I spend speaking and if, by any discussion, maybe you spoke the velocities February, 22 journals, he spent it going How long?
That doesn't certainly like allows them to focus well or you get activities or projects on as fast as otherIn that direction of the whole composition I think for like Hands-On activities like time should be measured like separately for each individual just because some for some people like they might get distracted more easily or they might have some like medical restrictions.
I think for like Hands-On activities like time should be measured like separately for each individual just because some for some people like they might get distracted more easily or they might have some like medical restrictions.
So like what types of activities we should take time?
My one days, I spent a long time working on that, as you like something you've been in here.
I was also thinking about, like maybe finding a way for the system, like to compare, like the ratio, someone's like time spent look like the quality that that task like delivered.
Like, I don't know because like, if you're doing a task that has like like alert low priority, or you have a test that I keep that wasn't super high quality and then you look at the time spent on that.
And when you look at the time, spent on that like that in fellas.
And when you look at the time, spent on that, I feel like that can tell us.
And I'm looking at this, I think I spent a lot still be useful for things that like you're trying to practice or improve your skills or something.
I'm looking at him, I think time spent, but also be useful for things that like you got trying to practice or improve your skills or something.
We're not like immunity because I think the more time you spend with the right to learn how to write good, they spend more time trying to do that.","Overall Summary: The conversation discussed ways to measure the progress of tasks, the frequency of keywords, and the time spent on activities to improve skills.
Details and Decisions:
- Discussed reducing objective measurements and assigning tasks with goals
- Suggested progress bars to show the different stages of work done by each participant
- Mentioned measuring the frequency of keywords and recording moments when they are used frequently
- Suggested measuring time spent on activities separately for each individual
- Discussed measuring the ratio of time spent to quality of task delivered
- Noted that time spent on activities can be useful for practicing and improving skills",48173,4891,688
2023-05-17 00:50:30,"And then you several times,  I think tanks went clubbing measured because we are looking at the output of because I'm actually trying to get learn things more.
I think banks went from we measured because we're only peanuts the output of the only trying to get things like that.
I think times when shall be measured because we are looking at is the output of the was actually trying to get little things more.
What you're giving him  I think times when trouble measure because you are not looking at the output of, what are you actually trying to get?
So,  I don't know if you solved the problem in this time because like analyzer, everyone has a different sales level as well.
So as long Yeah, I don't know if you saw the problem in less time than the moment I'm working on something to remember looking at Lenny.
It was already like these come with the trying to submit to admit, even to people very different amounts of time to like animals, or, you know, the same block.
Even with learning to people can take very different amounts of time to like analyze or even long same block as I feel like it's really subjective leaving of coding and everyone has a different experience level as well.
Somebody in this group has a task of making, like a scroll bar work, having made that way, and it doesn't matter if you've taken ten relationship or two hours.
Suppose what somebody in this group has the task of making like a scroll bar work, have you made that work and it doesn't matter if you've taken ten minutes for you to do wrong things.
I think you're right because cooking pan bar now has to do with deadlines, the liked a lot of companies that we work at.
Because you can find bar now has to do with their lives because even would like a lot of companies that you work at, they have a nine-hour thing, but they give you a task and at the end of the day you just have to finish that task.
Super special says you think it's necessary to track the level of participation during a Collaborative Learning activity?
You think it's necessary to track the level of participation during the Collaborative Learning activity?
Look like making sure people are engaged, so they know it's what's happening.
And it also give like and sound like how like if some of the certain folks are like not participating as much like things that we can do like to change our group dynamic to encourage that people who don't speak as much to feel comfortable saying there cause we're just sharing their personal.
So then you have some more like, I guess focused, or you know what's going on, you're not just because you're not participating, most of the time.
And it's like a measure to see someone actually actively participating in our yards passing, right?
Like I noticed that a lot of his students were just like not making eye contact, but that doesn't necessarily mean they weren't paying attention.
Like I noticed that a lot of his students were just like not making eye contact, but that doesn't necessarily mean they weren't paying attention.
There's also some people who actually like to really do I contact this much Molly Students were just like not making eye contact but that doesn't necessarily mean they weren't paying attention.
So sometimes there's  Students were just like not making eye contact, but that doesn't necessarily mean, they weren't paying attention.
Yeah, this is the spirit still do, but what  That's also a way to calibrate like this a cook and I'm looking with him here in spirit or doing some can suggest I think like had not to like I have to find people just doing this a lot when they're like actively listening.
Like for me personally like sometimes when I do talk to people like yeah I don't make eye contact with them when I when I'm trying to think of like how I want to like make a point.
Like, for me personally like sometimes when I do talk to people like yeah, I don't make eye contact like when I'm trying to think of like I want to like make a point like I'm sorry like moving my hands.
But what I try you came out or doing some relaxing can suggest you know, I think like had knots to like I have to find people just doing this a lot when they're like actively listening and agreeing but not necessarily looking at.
Like for me personally like sometimes when I do talk to people like yeah, I don't make eye contact, but I'm trying to think of like I want to like make a boy, like, as far as like blew, my hands were like I look Like I said, if I keep doing this a lot, when they're actively listening and agreeing, but not necessarily looking at can also consider like facial expressions.
Like for me personally like sometimes when I do talk to people like yeah, I don't make eye contact like when I'm trying to think of like I want to like make a point like as far as like moving my hands.
But when he's talking, I didn't, because like after two one, it's it depends on a lot of things and different people work differently.
Like, I think I found out that some people in the talking because you're sitting right across providers.
It depends on a lot of things and different people work differently and not everyone has the tendency to nod and say that activity is she like the questionnaire tries to just maybe not even a question.
Because like after Dylan, it's it depends on a lot of things and different people work differently and not everyone has the tendency to nod and yeah, every activity.
We pay attention to, I'm going to be like, why would I have to look?","Overall Summary: The conversation discussed the importance of tracking the level of participation during a Collaborative Learning activity, and the different ways people can show their engagement.

- Tracking the level of participation during a Collaborative Learning activity is important to ensure everyone is engaged.

2023-05-17 01:04:00,"So Maybe like, you know, I'm all the criteria that you want to take like this, your graphic about your bath, you can put it into larger radar chart type thing.
Yeah, I mean I don't really know the metrics are but the types can be like want to be eye contact was good because I didn't so obviously you have like a visualization that shows the frequency or the Neville of each eye contact.
I mean I don't really know the metrics are but the types could be like want to be eye contact.
I feel like I'm kind of skeptical of like telling the participants like what the criteria is like what they're getting graded on because I feel like like if if I know like like has been like has been mentioned like if I know that I just got to look issue or like if I have to present if I know what I need to do to pass like I probably going to do it so I feel like, I don't know.
I feel like I'm kind of skeptical of like telling the participants like what the criteria is like what they're getting graded on because I feel like like if if I know like like has been like Dimension, like by know that I just got to look issue or like if I have to present, if I know what I need to do to pass like a problem going to do it.
I hope they're getting greater than 0, because I really like if I know, like, when I know they just got to look at you or like, if I know what I need to do to pass like, I feel like my initial thought would be like, I feel like I'm kind of skeptical of like telling the participant, like what the criteria is like what they're getting right about.
Because I feel like like if if I know like has been like the mentioned like if I know that I just got to look issue or like if I have to present if I know what I need to do to pass, like I probably meant to do it so I feel like I don't know, my initial thought would be like like a little screen saying like based off of like our My initial thought is doing that right side, General statements, but like I think you also might be useful and part of me feels like, participants shouldn't know, but then the other part, like I feel like it could be useful in solving them ways that they can show their participation that we honor the paramedics.
Feels like the participant shouldn't know because then they're going to leave May modify their behavior.
But then, the other part, like I feel like it could be useful to tell them ways that they can show their participation that the Ugly American.
Feels like the participant shouldn't no because then they're going to leave May modify their behavior.
I think you're right because if you don't if we present or do I know I can A way that they can show their participation that the algorithm.
I just think that could be discouraging and I feel like maybe instead of that if you have like a graph or  Everyone knows how to do that.
But discussion if I get like a 2-1 participation as we know why.
Yeah I think we need to measure construction and participant satisfaction on a Collaborative, Learning be measured.I'm lost.
Like satisfaction like but I mean like they had a good meeting or that they feel like yeah I see.
Like satisfaction like but I mean like they had a good meeting or that they feel like yeah I see.
If you can satisfied with yourself and what you're able to put in something,  I think so just because usually when you make good progress or you feel like you put enough effort, you feel satisfied with yourself and that you are able to put in something.
I think so just because usually when you make good progress or you feel like you put enough effort, you feel satisfied with yourself and that you're able to put in something.
